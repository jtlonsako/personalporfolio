            <p className="text-left text-lg">
                Iâ€™m Josh. I am 25, was born and raised in Phoenix AZ, went to ASU for a 
                BSE in Computer Systems Engineering, and have been a professional 
                web developer for 2+ years.
            </p>
            <p className="text-left text-lg">
                In that time I worked primarily in the .NET world, either developing 
                web pages in C# using .NET/Blazor at Capgemini, adding new functionality 
                in  Visual Basic using .NET Framework at Avnet, or creating API points via 
                Azure Functions (again, C#). In addition, I have had professional 
                experience building greenfield apps with React, SvelteKit, and Java.
            </p>
            <p className="text-left text-lg">
                Through my 2+ years of experience, I have grown both a love and deep
                respect for developing tools that solve peopleâ€™s problems. Trial and error 
                has taught me that I can actually build anything if I put my mind to it, and 
                the beauty of the internet is that I get the opportunity to distribute my 
                solutions to the entire world instantly. By the end of my career, I hope I get
                to say that the problems I worked on made peopleâ€™s lives better, even if just by a little bit.
            </p>
            <p className="text-left text-lg">
                Aside from the career stuff, I like to play music (badly), watch movies, spend
                time with friends and family, and spending time with Jesus.
